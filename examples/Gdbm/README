Here is a green card interface for Gdbm (the gnu database package). Any
comments are welcome, to dahe@cre.canon.co.uk. The code comes with no
guarantees, and testing has been fairly superficial. Also, see the files
themselves for legal disclaimers. There's a sample makefile as well, because
you need some wacky options to the ghc.

You need the header gdbmplus.h to make things compile, as well as the gnu
gdbm files. If you want to use it with Windows, you'll need to change some of
the gdbm source files. Why? Because the authors of gdbm forgot to set the
binary flag when they open the files. "diffs" lists the changes.

Good luck!
